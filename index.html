      <h2>Unhurried Run Club</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the unhurried run club, a casual run club based in NYC. The
        club meets once a month on its second Saturday.

        For this inaugural run, we will be meeting at
        <strong>Bowling Green Park at 10am</strong>
        next to the fountain. We will run along the hudson river park and end at
        pier 57 for coffee and snacks. The route is approximately 3.25 miles.

        I am still deciding where subsequent club meetups should be. I chose the
        battery because our attendees live in places that range from hell's
        kitchen to williamsburg to park slope. For subsequent events, I would
        like to rotate the starting location between neighborhoods. Your
        feedback on meetup location is appreciated.
